# What Is My Tomato Plant Sick With

This project is a part of the AAI-521 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD).

--Project Status: [Completed]

## Installation

To use this project you can either clone the repo on your device using the command below:

git init

git clone https://github.com/J-Lehrer/what_is_my_tomato_plant_sick_with.git

Or you can download and unzip the completed model directly which is called:

tomato_disease_model-20241125T225856Z-001.zip

## Project Intro/Objective

The main purpose of this project is to create code of an image classifier model that will be able to take an image of a tomato plant leaf and give an output of the most likely type of sickness (if any) that the plant has out of 10 sicknesses.

## Project Description

### Dataset

Dataset kaggle URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishmotwani/tomato

Description of dataset from kaggle:

Tomato Leaf Disease Classification
Over 20k images of tomato leaves with 10 diseases and 1 healthy class. Images are collected from both lab scenes and in-the-wild scenes. The goal is to develop a lightweight model that can predict tomato leaf diseases & deploy it offline on a mobile app.

Classes:

 * Late_blight
 * healthy
 * Early_blight
 * Septorialeafspot
 * TomatoYellowLeafCurlVirus
 * Bacterial_spot
 * Target_Spot
 * Tomatomosaicvirus
 * Leaf_Mold
 * Spidermites Two-spottedspider_mite
 * Powdery Mildew
